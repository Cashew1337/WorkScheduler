## Work Scheduler Project

#Purpose
The purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple daily planner that will allow them to enter events based on the time of day. Those events will also persist

#Use

From there, enter your event in the hour block of your choice and click the save button to the right.
The event will save and if you refresh the browser the block will be populated with the saved event.

Below is a screenshot of what the site will look like:
